                Basic Concepts
            </h3>
            <p>
                Web 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 are conceptual buzz words ment to describe the everchanging World-Wide-Web.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="web">Web 1.0: </span>
                <br>
                Also known as the <span class="italic"> “readable”</span> phrase of the World Wide Web with flat data.
                In Web 1.0, there is only limited
                interaction between sites and web users. Web 1.0 is simply an information portal where users passively
                receive information without being given the opportunity to post reviews, comments, and feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="web">Web 2.0: </span>
                <br>
                Also known as the <span class="italic">“writable”</span> phrase of the World Wide Web with interactive
                data. Unlike Web 1.0, Web 2.0
                facilitates interaction between web users and sites, so it allows users to interact more freely with
                each other. Web 2.0 encourages participation, collaboration, and information sharing.
                <br>
                Some websites considered web 2.0 cannot be existed without users which are contributers, for example:
                Facebook would vanish if users will not
                contribute themselfs to it.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="web">Web 3.0: </span>
                <br>
                Also known as the <span class="italic"> “executable”</span> phrase of Word Wide Web with dynamic
                applications, interactive services, and
                “machine-to-machine” interaction. Web 3.0 is a semantic web which refers to the future. In Web 3.0,
                computers can interpret information like humans and intelligently generate and distribute useful content
                tailored to the needs of users. One example of Web 3.0 is Tivo, a digital video recorder. Its recording
                program can search the web and read what it finds to you based on your preferences.

                        experience.
                        These sites use AI and IoT to make the web feel like an intelligent human is out there making
                        sure you will get what you need.

                Q2: "Is there any difference between the webs if im shopping for a new computer?"
                <br>
                A2: Sure there is, lets see
            </h3>
            <p>
                <span class="web">In Web 1.0</span> shopping for a computer would force you to enter to every website that you know that sells
                computers and look for the computer that you like.
                If you are lucky you would find a shopping portal that would gather all shops of computer for you.
                <br>
                <span class="web">In Web 2.0</span> websites such as eBay have come to life. This means that now you surely have a portal of
                shops selling computers, and now also regular people (not stores) can post their own used computer or a
                brand new one.
                This would give you a much better choice and information about whats out there to buy.
                <br>
                <span class="web">In Web 3.0</span> you can enter a website such as Amazon and list all the requirments that you wish on the
                computer. The website would use his own algorithms to match you with the best product he can find.
                Also the website can recommend you of computers which are common by your internet profile as well as
                give you a completing products for the one you looked for - this would make your life much simpler!
